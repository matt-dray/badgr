# {badgr}

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {badgr} is to use R to generate URL endpoints for [shields.io](https://shields.io/) metadata badges that you can use in your repository's README file or elsewhere.

I'm not affiliated with the excellent [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

You can [back or donate to shields.io](https://opencollective.com/shields). Find out more from their:

* [website](https://shields.io/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shields_io)
* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HjJCwm5)
* [source code](https://github.com/badges/shields)

## Installation

You can install {badgr} from GitHub with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/badgr")
```

It's a work in progress and there are no guarantees.

## Examples

### Simple

This is a basic example that shows you how to generate the simplest possible badge.

```{r}
library(badgr)

badge <- get_badge(
  "Left bit", "Right bit", "blue",
  to_clipboard = FALSE,  # don't copy to clipboard
  open_browser = FALSE  # don't send to browser
)
```

The output looks like this:

```{r}
badge
```

Which when rendered, looks like this:

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Left_bit-Right_bit-blue?style=flat)

### More complex

Let's use a few more arguments. For example, we can include a pre-prepared logo from [https://simpleicons.org/](https://simpleicons.org/) and add separate links to each half of the badge.

```{r}
badge2 <- get_badge(
  label = "Left bit",
  message = "Right bit",
  color = "red",
  style = "for-the-badge",
  label_color = "blue",
  link_left = "https://rstudio.com/",
  link_right = "https://shields.io",
  logo_simple = "rstudio",
  logo_color = "white",
  logo_width = 20,
  open_browser = FALSE,
  include_md = TRUE,
  to_clipboard = FALSE
)

badge2
```

Which looks like this:

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Left_bit-Right_bit-red?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=blue&link=https://rstudio.com/&link=https://shields.io&logo=rstudio&logoColor=white&logoWidth=20)

### Custom logo

What if you don't want to use a logo from [https://simpleicons.org/](https://simpleicons.org/)? You can use your own. Here, for example, I'm using the [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) from my blog.

```{r}
# Path to favicon file
logo <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/master/static/images/favicon.ico"

badge3 <- get_badge(
  label = "rostrum.blog",
  message = "post",
  color = "008900",
  label_color = "black",
  link_left = "https://rostrum.blog/",
  link_right = "https://rostrum.blog/",
  logo_path = logo,
  open_browser = FALSE,
  include_md = FALSE,
  to_clipboard = FALSE
)

badge3
```

Which looks like this (note that the image is subtly animated):

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/rostrum.blog-post-008900?style=flat&labelColor=black&link=https://rostrum.blog/&link=https://rostrum.blog/&logo=data:image/ico;base64,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)

The output string for this example was much longer than for the previous examples and contains what looks like semi-random characters. This is the result of converting the image into [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) with `base64enc::base64encode()`.
